<h3 id="machine-learning-sabbatical-july-2018---now">Machine Learning Sabbatical: <em>July 2018 - Now</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Deep Learning Paper Implementations</em>:
<ul>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/tfmr">implemented</a> a modified version of the decoder component from <em>Vaswani et al. Attention Is All You Need</em> and used it to train a language model with a baking cookbook.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/superconv">implemented</a> the <em>1cycle</em> learning rate policy from <em>Leslie N. Smith. Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Neural Networks Using Large Learning Rates</em> and verified the reported empirical results.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/clr">implemented</a> the <em>learning rate range test</em> from Leslie N. Smith. Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks and verified the reported empirical results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Machine Learning Projects:</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/rx">I trained a character level language model using an LSTM on the BNF</a> and wrote inference code to run it in the browser for a fun(-ish) <a href="https://rx.coxy1989.com/">mini-game</a>.</li>
<li>I entered the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification">Human Protein Atlas Image Classification</a> Kaggle competition with a friend and finished <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification/leaderboard">in the top 22%</a> (Team Name: Eigencorp), despite not being able to afford sufficient GPU time to train on the full resolution images :(</li>
<li>I entered <a href="https://solveitsew.devpost.com/">South East Water’s preventing bursts hackathon</a> with a friend, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kaTD7jr0DhJR7IDXVY0lVQ7-jD_r_qhhgqzK9_5nKRc/edit#slide=id.p">our solution</a> got a special mention from the judges and we were awarded with a small cash prize.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/house-prices">I entered</a> the <em>House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques</em> Kaggle competition and got a score in the top 20%.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/west-nile-virus">I did a detailed EDA</a> on the data from the <em>West Nile Virus Prediction</em> Kaggle competition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Courses:</em>
<ul>
<li>I read Tibshirani and Hastie’s <em>Introduction to Statistical Learning With applications in R</em> <a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/isl">and did the labs and exercises in Python rather than R</a>. I implemented several of the algorithms from that book and <em>The Elements of Statistical Learning</em> <a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/algs">from scratch in numpy</a>.</li>
<li>I took Andrew Ng’s <a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/ng_ml"><em>Machine Learning</em></a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/8PMHWASDBR88"><em>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</em></a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/DTG5PML6SWAJ"><em>Sequence Models</em></a> courses. I also took Jeremy Howard’s fast.ai course.</li>
<li>I took Pavel Grinfeld’s Linear Algebra course from Drexel, available via <a href="https://www.lem.ma/">lem.ma</a> and took Imperial College’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/ARMLMTNPZJTD">Mathematics for Machine Learning specialisation</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I kept a <a href="https://www.coxy1989.com/learning_log.html">learning log</a> from 15/07/2018 up until 18/12/2018, when I got tired of keeping it up to date :s</em></p>
<h3 id="software-engineer-touchpress-which-became-amphio-july-2015---july-2018">Software Engineer @ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpress">Touchpress</a> (which became) <a href="https://www.amphio.co/">Amphio</a>: <em>July 2015 - July 2018</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Systems:</em> Our team delivered core services for important artistic and scientific institutions. I was lead software engineer on the <a href="https://www.amphio.co/iso.html">ISO Library</a> and <a href="https://www.amphio.co/iop-events.html">IOP events</a> projects. I wrote the web front-ends in Clojurescript and implemented (AWS) lambda functions and workers on the backend in Python. I deployed these systems on AWS using Terraform and used CircleCI for continuous integration and delivery.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Prototyping:</em> I <a href="https://github.com/coxy1989/soundarama_open_source">implemented</a> a novel distributed PA system called <em>“Soundarama”</em> for a series of events at Frank Gehry’s iconic <em>Fondation Louis Vuitton</em> gallery in Paris. The system connected one hundred iOS devices owned by the gallery to enable a DJ, using an iPad, to play audio stems though the devices in very tight musical time. Participants could augment the sound using the accelerometer and gyroscope in their devices. I wrote the applications in Swift using the functional reactive programming paradigm afforded by the ReactiveCocoa library.</p></li>
<li><p><em>New Platforms:</em> We had a great relationship with Apple, <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/663750294837178368">Tim Cook visited us during a trip to London</a>. We were provided with pre-release access to Apple devices, including the AppleTV, iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. I implemented major components of the first applications for these devices including <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/classical-music-reimagined/id1046460216">Classical Music Reimagined</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/millie-marottas-colouring-adventures/id1064432319?mt=8">Millie Marotta’s Colouring Adventures</a>.</p></li>
<li><em>Workflows:</em> I introduced several tools to improve our internal workflows:
<ul>
<li>I wrote scripts to safely migrate repositories from our legacy SVN system to git.</li>
<li>I wrote a small web application which our video production team’s clients used to stream the latest work.</li>
<li>I wrote slack integrations which delivered notifications when AWS alarms were triggered in our production systems.</li>
<li>I introduced Terraform and championed auditable and reproducible infrastructure in AWS.</li>
<li>I introduced Fastlane for automated distribution of iOS builds to TestFlight and the App Store.</li>
</ul></li>
